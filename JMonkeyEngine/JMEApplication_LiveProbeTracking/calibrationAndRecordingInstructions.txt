NOTE:
First property in live tracking is now whether or not to turn on signal tracking

To Record Paths:

1. Locate the probe at the desired start point
2. Press N to begin recording
3. Move the probe along the desired path
4. Press N to stop recording
5. The output folder will contain the result files

To begin calibration:
1. Find one of the files with prefix "calibrationProperties_..."
2. Copy it and make the suffix the name of your current mesh

Doing scale calibration:

1. Measure the real world distance between the points
2. Find the virtual distance between the points. 
	- This is accomplished by looking at the file "compressedPathInfo..." for the recorded path
3. Find out the (virtualDistance)/(realDistance) ratio and put it into the scale factor
		field in the calibration properties file for your mesh

Doing Rotation Calibration:

1. Put the probe on a calibration point
2. Press B
3. Click the calibration point you are on
4. Move the probe to another calibration point
5. Hit space bar
6. Click the calibration point moved to
7. The rotation quaternion will be in the text file with prefix "CalibrationResults..."
	in the output folder
8. If the result was good, then put the quaternion into the calibration properties 
	file for the mesh
